# Rasica Governance

The Rasica governance system will be coordinated through a DAO.

## Definitions

* A _maintainer_ is anyone who plays an active role in governance.
* A _collaborator_ is active in the community, but not in governance.
* A _participant_ is anyone who is a maintainer or collaborator.
* A _working group_ is a group of maintainers that are formed to take responsibility for certain aspects of the Rasica Foundation. Normally these groups will meet regularly but in some cases will only meet as required to fulfil their responsibilities.
